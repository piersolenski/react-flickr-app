# React Flickr App

A Flickr feed preview app built in React.

## Features

* [All Create React App features](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#whats-inside)
* React Router
* SCSS
* Autoprefixer
* Responsive Images
* SVG sprites
* Automatic polyfilling (using Polyfill.io)

## Getting started

Check out a [working demo](https://react-flickr-app.firebaseapp.com/).

### `npm install`

Install the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Testing

### `npm run test`

## Polyfills

We use [Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/) to polyfill missing Javascript functionality. Simply add any missing functionality by appending the polyfill.io url in `src/public/index.html` with the feature you need.

## TODO

* Full unit test coverage + e2e tests
